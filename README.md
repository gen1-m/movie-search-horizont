This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), which was done by me [Geni](https://github.com/gen1-m).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/list-movie.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## üìî Quick Summary of what you can expect from HorizontMovies 

It is a simple website created with [OMDb Api](https://www.omdbapi.com) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) on top of [React.js](https://react.dev/) for searching movies and all of the information you can possibly think, from the actors, awards, writers, etc. 
As soon as you open the page you are presented with some of the 'Popular' movies in some very modest cards which display the name, movie paster and the year the movie was made. When you click the card with the title and year, you will be redirected to another page with the plot of the movie and more information regarding it. 
You can find a useful search feature in the home page to search movies by title and by clicking at the card with the name of the movie, you can go to the movie's own page about the plot and the extended information as you did with movies in the home page. Each movie card has a the movie poster and a ‚ù§Ô∏è button to like the movie. When you like a movie, it appears in the home page under the new section 'Favorites'. That's pretty much it.
